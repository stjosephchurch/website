                        <strong>Joseph</strong> the husband of Mary, mother of Jesus, and is venerated as Saint Joseph in the
                        Catholic Church, Orthodox Church Oriental Orthodox Church, Anglican Communion, Lutheranism and Methodism.
                        Christian tradition places Joseph as Jesus' legal father. Some historians state that Joseph was Jesus' father.
                        Some differing views are due to theological interpretations versus historical views.

                        In both Catholic and Protestant traditions, Joseph is regarded as the patron saint of workers and is associated
                        with various feast days. Pope Pius IX declared him to be both the patron and the protector of the Catholic Church
                        , in addition to his patronages of the sick and of a happy death, due to the belief that he died in the presence
                        of Jesus and Mary. In popular piety, Joseph is regarded as a model for fathers and has also become patron of various
                        dioceses and places.
